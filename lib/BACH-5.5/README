This directory contains the benchmark instances, the script and executables used in the experimental evaluation.

    BACH: a Bounded reAchability CHecker for linear hybrid automata.

The directory structure is as follows:

bach 
    the binary of BACH

lib/
    contains the library files needed to run BACH

benchmarks/
    contains the benchmark instances for compositional hybrid automata in spaceEx formats

    benchmarks/run_interaction.py
        the script to run the experiment

    benchmarks/result_interaction/ 
        is the output directory with results of running the benchmarks

For reproducing the results of the competition, the script "run_interaction.py" should be run *FROM benchmarks/ directory*.
Before running run_interaction.py you have to make sure "runlim" is installed.
If not, use the following command to install:
    sudo apt-get install runlim

The time limit for experiments is set to 1000 s, and the memory usage limit is set to 4 GB.
All experiments will take about 10 mininutes.

To use the BACH tool directly, with given input xml and cfg files in spaceEx formats, please refer to the manual by running:
	./bach --help
